## Warning!
This branch is deprecated, means that you can still use it, but it has alot of syncing issues and is not up to date.
Currently i'm planning to use jimp to generate custom captchas and let the user (you) decide **whether to use images or text** as captcha. (You probably came to this branch because of text as captcha)

Look into the <a href="https://github.com/y21/discordcaptcha/projects/1">3.0.0 project page</a> to see the progress.

A Captcha verification bot based on Discord.js.

You can find a detailed tutorial <a href="https://www.gitbook.com/book/y21/discordcaptcha/">here</a>.

## Setup procedure
DiscordCaptcha requires NodeJS 8.0+. Install it <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/">here</a>.<br />
To install all required NPM-Modules, run the install script in `~/setup/` (.sh or .bat file depends on your operating system) (or `npm install` <b>in bots' directory</b> if both don't work.) (Click <a href="https://discordjs.guide/#/preparations/?id=installing-nodejs">here</a> for a detailed installation tutorial on how to install nodejs)<br/><br/>
For now, make sure the bot is only in one guild.
The config file is located in `~/src/`. Get your Token from <a href="https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me">here</a>.


## Additional commands

```js
/**
* Snowflake: ID
* Mention: A basic mention (looks like <@123456789>)
**/
!block <Snowflake | Mention> // Blocks a User ID. If the User sends a message to the guild, he'll get kicked.
!removeBlock <Snowflake | Mention> // Removes a User ID from the blacklist. User can write again without getting kicked.
!clear <Amount of messages> // Clears an amount of messages, up to 100
!version // The current version and the latest version
!create-role // Creates the verification role
```

## Generated captchas
The generated captchas are <b>pseudo random</b>, which means that they were generated by an algorithm that could be calculated.

## API related commands

```js
!api queries // Current query
!api querydelete // Deletes the query (should be executed every 2 or 3 weeks)
!api purgelogs // Purges the logs
!api logs // Get logs
```
<b>Note: </b>If you want to use these commands, you have to put your tag into the `contributors` array.
